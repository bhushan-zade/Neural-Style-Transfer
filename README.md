# Neural Style Transfer 

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an optimization technique that involves the utilization of deep convolutional neural network and algorithms to extract the content information from an image (content image) and the style information from another reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
 
This technique is used by many popular android iOS apps such as Prisma, DreamScope, PicsArt.

# Tensorflow Hub

TensorFlow Hub is a collection of trained machine learning models that you can use with ease. TensorFlow’s official description for the Hub is as follows:

    TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained machine learning models ready for fine-tuning and deployable anywhere.
    Reuse trained models like BERT and Faster R-CNN with just a few lines of code.  
    
Apart from pre-trained models such as BERT or Faster R-CNN, there are a good amount of pre-trained models. The one **I used for Project** is **Magenta’s Arbitrary Image Stylization network**. Let’s take a look at what Magenta is.

## Magenta and Arbitrary Image Stylization

**`What is Magenta?`**

Magenta is an open-source research project, backed by Google, which aims to provide machine learning solutions to musicians and artists. Magenta has support in both Python and Javascript. Using Magenta, we can create songs, paintings, sounds, and more. For this project, I used a neural network which is trained and maintained by the Magenta team for Arbitrary Image Stylization.
